![A tugboat and the sentence Howdy, I'm Henne I hack Free Software](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hennevogel/hennevogel/master/Screenshot%20from%202020-07-18%2019-09-01.png)

I'm a software engineering manager helping people to realize their full potential. For the good of the business and for themselves. I am also a developer of the modern web. And for more than two decades I am a rigorous practitioner of Free Software development.

My day job at [SUSE](https://suse.com) is hacking, operating and maintaining the Linux release engineering platform [Open Build Service](https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/).

In my spare time I hone my skills by hacking a library to instrument Ruby on Rails applications ([influxdb-rails](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-rails/)). Leading an Open Source project that is producing a conference organization app ([OSEM](https://github.com/openSUSE/osem)). And by teaching free software development with programs like [RailsGirls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/).
